# User Stories

## What are User Stories?
User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality told from the perspective of the end user.  
They help development teams understand **what the user wants**, **why they want it**, and **how it will bring value**.  

A typical user story follows this format:  
> *As a [type of user], I want to [perform an action] so that [I achieve a goal].*

## Purpose in This Project
In this Airbnb Clone (Booking Management System), user stories:  
- Capture the needs of **guests, hosts, and admins**.  
- Provide a foundation for creating and prioritizing the **product backlog**.  
- Guide developers and designers in building features that align with **real-world user needs**.  
- Help ensure the system remains user-focused and goal-driven.  

## Next Steps
- See [`user-stories.md`](./user-stories.md) for the full list of user stories.
